Our project for ESRP is to build a web based tool that designs Split-LAMP primers for miRNA detection. The tool will accept two miRNA inputs, calculate GC concentration, melting temperatures, and ΔG values, and generate primer sets that avoid secondary structures. Our work will focus on implementing an algorithm programmed in Python that will analyze sequence features and produce primer outputs. I will also implement the algorithm into our website build on React so users can input miRNA sequences with ease and view the generated primers output.
